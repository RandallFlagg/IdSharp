.NET 8+, Cross Platform, ID3 Tagging Library.

## Project Origins

This is a fork of [IdSharp](https://github.com/judwhite/IdSharp).

## NuGet
If you want to use this library you basiclly need only the Tagging package which has a dependency on the common package.
Here are the links for both of the packages. More packages will come in the (near?) future.
